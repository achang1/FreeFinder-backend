## Installation
Install the following packages
` pip install flask flask-restful flask-jwt-simple sqlalchemy bcrypt mysqlclient `

If you get an error for mysqlclient installation on Windows, you might have to manually install an older version of mysql (maybe 32-bit even if on 64-bit OS) to get the pip install to work:
